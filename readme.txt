This tool was made to visualize how the stems of opentype font families grow.
The script uses fonttools ttx to generate an xml file and read the sidebearing and width values of the dotlessi.
It is assumed that left and right sidebearings are the same.
The stem thickness results from two times the lsb substracted from the the width of the dotlessi.
